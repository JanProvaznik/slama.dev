This section covers various kinds of books that I think are worth reading.

### Fantasy

{:.book}
- **The Stormlight Archive** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive)] by Brandon Sanderson -- by far the most interesting fantasy world I have explored. The books are relatively long (save Edgedancer, which is a novella set between the 1st and the 2nd book), but very much worth the read (or listen).
	1. **The Way of Kings**
	2. **Words of Radiance**
	3. **Oathbringer**
	4. **The Rhythm of War**

- **Mistborn** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn_series)] by Brandon Sanderson -- another amazing series from Brandon Sanderson. It has a well thought-out magic system, despite being set in the same universe as The Stormlight Archive ([Cosmere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson#Cosmere)). The first and the second series vary greatly in their setting (medieval {% latex %}\times{% endlatex %} industrial revolution), but I would argue that both are a great fit.
	1. **The Final Empire**
	2. **The Well of Ascension**
	3. **The Hero of Ages**
	4. **The Alloy of Law**
	5. **Shadows of Self**
	6. **The Bands of Mourning**
	7. **The Lost Metal** (to be released)

- **Skyward** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyward_(novel))] by Brandon Sanderson -- as a huge fan of Sanderson's fictional work, I was not sure about him pulling off a good space opera, but I was very, very wrong. The series is a breath of fresh air in the midst of all of his fantasy worlds (at least to someone who's practically been binging all of Sanderson's work) and I can't recommend it enough.
	1. **Skyward**
	2. **Starsight**
	3. **Nowhere** (to be released)

- **The Rithmatist** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rithmatist)] by Brandon Sanderson -- an excellent young adult fantasy novel. Although the target audience is children (which is reflected mostly in character behavior and development), I still loved discovering the unique magic system that Sanderson created.

- **Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_(novella_series))] by Brandon Sanderson -- a set of three novellas about a man, whose hallucinations (so-called aspects) help him with logic, problem solving, languages and much more. It's quite catchy and has an exciting ending, but definitely I'm more into his fantasy works.

- **The Reckoners** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reckoners)] by Brandon Sanderson -- a set of three novels set in a post-apocalyptic world where random people are transformed into superhumans with various kinds of abilities. The atmosphere is great, but the writing is targeted at a younger audience, which is definitely noticable.
	1. **Steelheart**
	2. **Firefight**
	3. **Calamity**

- **The Kingkiller Chronicle** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingkiller_Chronicle)] by Patrick Rothfuss -- a thrilling series that I would not recommend anyone to read until the last book in the series is finished (see the controversy for yourself if you're interested).
	1. **The Name of the Wind**
	2. **The Wise Man's Fear**

- **Metro 2033** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_2033)] by Dimitry Glukhovsky -- a post-apocalyptic novel about people surviving a nuclear world war inside the Moscow metro. I really appreciated that there was a healthy mix of both action-packed passages and slower, more philosophical ones. Definitely worth the read, but the other books in the series are not as good (in my opinion).

### Comedy

{:.book}
- **Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!)] by Ralph Leighton and Richard Feynman -- an absolute must-read auto(sort-of)biography about the life of Richard Feynman. I honestly don't understand how this many interesting things can happen in the life of a single person.

- **The Martian** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel))] by Andy Weir -- a hilarious novel about an astronaut surviving on Mars, after being left for dead due to an unfortunate series of events. It inspired a [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)#Reception), which (while not as good as the book) is also quite entertaining.

### Maths and Computer Science

{:.book}
- [CZ] **Průvodce labyrintem algoritmů** [[PDF](http://pruvodce.ucw.cz/static/pruvodce.pdf)] od Martina Mareše -- úžasná příručka (a skripta) pro studium algoritmů a datových struktur. Vřele doporučeno komukoliv, koho alespoň trochu zajímá teoretická informatika.

- [CZ] **Lineární Algebra (nejen) pro informatiky** [[PDF verze 2018](https://www.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~sejkoraji/sbirka/zalohy/skripta_la.pdf)] od Milana Hladíka -- kvalitně zpracovaná (byť dle mého názoru občas ne úplně přístupná) skripta pro Lineární Algebru.

- **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** [[PDF 2. ed.](http://guanzhou.pub/files/Computer%20System_EN.pdf)] -- an in-depth look at how computers actually work. A very comprehensive resource for CS-related courses, namely for those related to computer architecture.
