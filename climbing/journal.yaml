  blue: 0/3
  yellow: 0/1
  note: Today's gravity felt pretty good!
2021-08-16:
  red: 0/4
  yellow: 0/1
  note: I had my second Covid shot on Friday and was out for the entire weekend, so it was surprising that I managed to do the yellow one and make progress on a few blue ones!
2021-08-17:
  red: 1/0
  salmon: 1/0
  yellow: 1/0
  blue: 0/1
  note: Today was a pretty tired day, considering the climbing I did yesterday. At least I finished the blue one I made progress on yesterday and tried a few new yellow ones to do.
2021-08-20:
  red: 1/0
  blue: 0/5
  note: It seems that the rest day really worked, I managed to do 5 new blue ones and real progress on a new blue and a yellow, both of which will hopefully go next session.
2021-08-23:
  yellow: 1/1
  salmon: 0/1
  note: First session with new shoes (Skwamas). The yellow was surprisingly not bad. Also, I made progress on two other yellows that seem pretty difficult, but will probably go after a few attempts.
2021-09-01:
  yellow: 1/1
  salmon: 1/0
  red: 1/0
  note: The entire session was spent on the last two yellows in zone 9 that I haven't yet done. The first one went after about 20 tries and I managed to make all individual moves on the second one, so today was quite a success!
2021-09-02:
  yellow: 0/2
  salmon: 1/0
  red: 4/0
  note: I completely forgot about those two yellows, because I felt pretty weak when I first tried them. Today was quite different though, as both of them went in only a couple of tries!
