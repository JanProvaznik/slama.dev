  note: Although I took a break for more than 10 days and it definitely feels like it, I found a very nice beta for the new yellow that I sent, which is super nice. I also did two new blues and filmed some salmons that I missed last session (because my battery died).

  note: In the new rebuild, all of the blues (besides one) feel very easy, same as the salmon ones (again, besides one). However, the yellows feel completely impossible. I'll try to finish the two easy blues that I haven't done next session, and will begin working on the yellows after that.

  note: I did the salmon in the 45 (it was actually pretty easy, just pumpy) and one more on the island. Then I again projected the new yellows.
2021-10-26:
  note: I started doing sport climbing! This session was spent at Big Wall and was bad, because I'm not very good at sport climbing. I'll still try to do a sports climbing session once in a while to improve my endurance, which at this point is quite lacking.
2021-10-28:
  note: Second sport climbing session, this time at Smíchoff. I did some 7's and an onsight of 8, which I'm pretty happy about. I then finished up with some bouldering, getting closer to climbing the new yellows.
2021-10-30:
  note: I projected the yellow in the 45 (almost got the top sequence done) and the one on the island (literally fell while matching the top hold). I'm very confident in finishing the one on the island next session, and linking the one in 45.
2021-11-02:
  note: The new routes all seem pretty easy. I'm honestly not sure whether I'm getting stronger or the climbs are getting easier. Of the three remaining yellows, I think the jumpy and the traverse one will go, but the volumy one seems completely impossible.

  note: There was a rebuilt on Monday and a boulder challenge today. It went surprisingly well -- I climbed all of the new boulders that were easier than yellows (which I'm very happy about, since my endurance is quite poor), and three of the new yellows, ending in the 2nd place, only a few points after the insanely strong Lukáš Mokroluský. There are two other hard yellows that I think I can finish next session, and a new long-term project yellow.

2021-12-14:
