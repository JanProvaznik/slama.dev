  note: I had my second Covid shot on Friday and was out for the entire weekend, so it was surprising that I managed to do the yellow one and make progress on a few blue ones!

  note: It seems that the rest day really worked, I managed to do 5 new blue ones and real progress on a new blue and a yellow, both of which will hopefully go next session.

  note: First session with new shoes (Skwamas). The yellow was surprisingly not bad. Also, I made progress on two other yellows that seem pretty difficult, but will probably go after a few attempts.

  note: The entire session was spent on the last two yellows in zone 9 that I haven't yet done. The first one went after about 20 tries and I managed to make all individual moves on the second one, so today was quite a success!

  note: I completely forgot about those two yellows, because I felt pretty weak when I first tried them. Today was quite different though, as both of them went in only a couple of tries!

  note: Today was not good. I felt tired, but at least still managed to do the crimpy salmon that I struggled with. Also, I made many more tries on the last yellow one in the pool, but no dice -- at least I got the beta down!.

  note: Today was worse. I felt much more tired and wrongly assumed that there will be new boulders today, which there weren't. I made some good attempts on the last yellow on the pool and the hard blue in the ball, at least.

  note: Most of the new boulders were built. I did quite a few of them, but I'm recording only the ones that weren't changed. None of them were recorded because of this, but will be in the next few sessions.

  note: The new boulders should be finalized at this point. I still have yet to do two the last two new yellows, but they're very tough. The camera died halfway through the session, so they will be recorded in the next few sessions.

  note: Although I took a break for more than 10 days and it definitely feels like it, I found a very nice beta for the new yellow that I sent, which is super nice. I also did two new blues and filmed some salmons that I missed last session (because my battery died).

  note: The new boulders feel harder than the previous batch (namely the yellows). I still feel a bit sick (had sore throat and fever 2 days ago), but I still managed to do some salmons, blues and even a yellow. Next time should feel much better.

  note: The two easier yellows from the new boulders went down, along with the last blue (super nice coordination move, weird end) and the last salmon too. I also managed to repeat the yellow one that I haven't filmed yet. Now to start projecting the other yellows, which are just brutal...

  note: I felt pretty weak again today, so I just climbed some boulders that I've climbed already. Besides that, I managed one new salmon with a really weird beta and real progress on the hard blue in the overhang.

  note: I made more progress on the blue in the overhang, which I've managed to piece together for the first time today. I also tried the easiest yellow I haven't climbed yet and made a few good attempts too, it will hopefully go soon.
