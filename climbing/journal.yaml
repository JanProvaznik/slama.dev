  note: I had my second Covid shot on Friday and was out for the entire weekend, so it was surprising that I managed to do the yellow one and make progress on a few blue ones!

  note: Today was a pretty tired day, considering the climbing I did yesterday. At least I finished the blue one I made progress on yesterday and tried a few new yellow ones to do.

  note: It seems that the rest day really worked, I managed to do 5 new blue ones and real progress on a new blue and a yellow, both of which will hopefully go next session.

  note: First session with new shoes (Skwamas). The yellow was surprisingly not bad. Also, I made progress on two other yellows that seem pretty difficult, but will probably go after a few attempts.

  note: The entire session was spent on the last two yellows in zone 9 that I haven't yet done. The first one went after about 20 tries and I managed to make all individual moves on the second one, so today was quite a success!

  note: I completely forgot about those two yellows, because I felt pretty weak when I first tried them. Today was quite different though, as both of them went in only a couple of tries!

  note: Today was not good. I felt tired, but at least still managed to do the crimpy salmon that I struggled with. Also, I made many more tries on the last yellow one in the pool, but no dice -- at least I got the beta down!.

  note: Today was worse. I felt much more tired and wrongly assumed that there will be new boulders today, which there weren't. I made some good attempts on the last yellow on the pool and the hard blue in the ball, at least.

  note: Most of the new boulders were built. I did quite a few of them, but I'm recording only the ones that weren't changed. None of them were recorded because of this, but will be in the next few sessions.

  note: The new boulders should be finalized at this point. I still have yet to do two the last two new yellows, but they're very tough. The camera died halfway through the session, so they will be recorded in the next few sessions.
