This page is dedicated to some of the harder climbs that I've done and am happy with.

## [Smíchoff](https://www.lezeckecentrum.cz/cs/), Prague
Smíchoff is the only gym in Prague that I frequent, since it is (in my opinion) the best one, so the vast majority of the clips are going to be from here. People are nice, prices are student-friendly and boulders are frequently changed, so it's a perfect place to be.

The difficulty of boulders are as follows (left being the easiest, right being the hardest):

The videos are split into various sections, mostly for practical reasons (easier to find a send when you know where it is located). To see the videos from the given section, simply click on it. Additionally, colors denote the type of overhang for the section of the gym: <mark class="climbing climbing-low-angle">low-angle</mark>, <mark class="climbing climbing-vertical">vertical</mark>, <mark class="climbing climbing-mild-overhang">mild overhang</mark>, <mark class="climbing climbing-severe-overhang">severe overhang</mark> and <mark class="climbing climbing-roof">roof</mark>.

Alternatively, the page with all of the climbs can be found [here](/climbing/zones/all).
