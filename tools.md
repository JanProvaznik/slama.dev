Here is an exhaustive list of software that I use (for one reason or another).
I made it both to showcase cool software that you might have missed and for personal brainstorming purposes.

If you think there are some interesting programs that I should check out, I'd be more than happy to hear about them!

### Editing
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) -- the ultimate text editor. Takes ~~a while~~ forever to get used to, but it's more than worth the effort (seriously).
	- [Ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) -- a general linter for any language you can imagine. Useful for spotting mistakes in smaller snippets that I don't use IDEs for.
	- [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) -- a plugin for creating Wikis. Very useful for writing things down (in Markdown syntax) and linking them together.
	- [UltiSnips](https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips) -- a plugin for creating expanding snippets. I use it almost constantly, whether it's writing emails or typesetting math in {% latex %}\LaTeX{% endlatex %}.
	- [surround.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) -- a plugin for surrounding parts of text with brackets/tags. Useful for working with tag-heavy markup languages like HTML, and for bracketing in general.
	- [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors) -- handy little plugin for managing multiple selections at once, similar to Atom and Sublime Text.
	- [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) -- a plugin for showing Git diffs in the sign column.

- [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/) -- although I will always be a huge fan of Vim, it's not an IDE and will never be, so writing more complex code in it is a bad idea. This means that when I need to work on a project, I use one of the following (with a Vim plugin, of course):
	- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) for C/C++
	- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for Python
	- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) for C#

### Command Line
- [Ranger](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ranger) -- a text-based file manager. The controls feel quite natural to me thanks to its Vim-like key bindings.
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/) -- a (f)riendly (i)nteractive (sh)ell. Features out-of-the-box autosuggestions, has a nice scripting syntax, a [vi mode](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#fish_vi_mode), and is overall much more pleasant to work with than Bash.

### Internet Browsing
- [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) -- a great Vim-oriented browser, that is not as polished as most other browsers out there, but has much better controls.
	- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) -- better than Google Search.

### Email
- [Neomutt](https://github.com/neomutt/) + [Offlineimap](https://www.offlineimap.org/) + [MSMTP](https://marlam.de/msmtp/) + [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/) -- after using ThunderBird for a year, mail was still one part of my workflow that just didn't fit in. During the summer of 2020, I started experimenting with Neomutt and although difficult to setup, it's really great to use.

### Audio/Video
- [MPV](https://mpv.io/) -- a multiplatform media player. I switched to it from VLC, since it's much more lightweight, customizable and doesn't completely break my window manager.

### Graphics
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) -- a bitmap image editor.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) -- a vector image editor.

### Note-taking
- [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp) -- an app for taking handwritten notes that I use to manage all of my notes from my classes. Similar to OneNote, but mostly focused on writing.

### Miscellaneous
- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) -- an awesome tiling window manager that I use on all my Linux devices. 
- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) -- a decentralized cross-platform app for syncing files that I use to sync all of my data across Android, Linux and Windows, mostly without trouble.
