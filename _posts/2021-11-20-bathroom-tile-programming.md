This post is a follow-up to the [latest video I released](TODO) on my YouTube channel about bathroom programming. It contains a few other problems that didn't make it into the video (so it wouldn't be too long) but are interesting to try to solve on your own.

	<summary><strong>Task:</strong> accept the input \(\iff\) it contains balanced parentheses</summary>

	<div markdown="1">
A simple solution that has the time complexity \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) can be found in the video, so this solution concerns only the faster \(\mathcal{O}(\log n)\) one, which is asymptotically optimal.

The idea is to count, how many parentheses we've seen so far and store it in the columns of the tiling as a binary number. When we see a one, we increment -- if the previous bit was 0, we put 1 to the right and don't carry. If it was a 1, we put 0 and do carry (see the diagram above). Same goes for decrementing:

If we wanted to make the tileset a little more concise, we could exchange the red color (that is mostly there for clarity) with a zero, yielding the following:

	<summary><strong>Task:</strong> accept the input \(\iff\) if contains the same number of zeroes and ones</summary>
	<div markdown="1">
The solution is very similar to the previous example. We're again counting in binary. The main difference is that we can go "negative" (since there can sometimes be more zeroes and sometimes more ones), which we handle by counting with two different sets of tiles for positive and negative numbers.

The time complexity is \(\mathcal{O}(\log n)\).

<details>
	<summary><strong>Task:</strong> accept the input \(\iff\) the number of ones in the input is a power of 2</summary>
	<div markdown="1">
The main trick here is to realize that numbers in the form \(2^n - 1\) are made out of \(n\) ones in binary, which we can match against the right side of the wall when filling from the left. The only thing we have to figure out is how to subtract one -- this we can do with a different left color and a set of tiles that simply ignore the first one on the input and only then start the count, which is the same as the previous task.

The time complexity is \(\mathcal{O}(\log n)\).

<details>
	<summary><strong>Task:</strong> accept the input \(\iff\) it's a palindrome (of zeroes and ones)</summary>
	<div markdown="1">
The idea behind the solution is to connect the first and last character and move the rest of the string to the next level. The side colors are there for the odd-size blocks end up in the middle (if the length of the palindrome is odd).
