With the end of the summer holidays and the beginning of a new semester, I've been thinking about clever ways to trick myself into being productive.

There are, of course, a bazillion apps, services and techniques to help with this, some of which I've used in the past. I felt, however, that none of them captured the hours of work I put into whatever I deemed productive in a meaningful way.

That's why I came up with the concept of a productivitree. Here is mine:

The idea is simple: for each productive hour, I fill in a single gray dot, the color depending on the type of activity I did (education-related dots are blue, others are black[^1]).

Although this might not be a groundbreaking discovery in the field of procrastination, I wanted to share this anyway, since some people might find it useful/interesting.

### Generating the image
The above image was generated using **weighted stippling**, which is a technique where a given image is converted into a set of points of varying thickness (see [this paper](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~ajsecord/npar2002/npar2002_ajsecord_preprint.pdf) if you're interested in the math behind it).

I used the [StippleGen](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2012/stipplegen-weighted-voronoi-stippling-and-tsp-paths-in-processing/) program when generating my image. It should run on any major operating system and has a pretty straightforward UI, exporting directly to SVG.

[^1]: If your system prefers dark theme, the dots will yellow/white, since the colors are inverted.
