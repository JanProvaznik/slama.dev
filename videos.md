I occasionally create videos about math/computer science that I put up on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IaBSHmisYbiYlv32EeNkQ), written in Python with Manim. Their source code is open and can be [found here](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/videos).

Regarding tooling, I use `sox` and `arecord` to record and process the audio and Kdenlive to cut the video. For music, I use [blue dots sessions](https://app.sessions.blue/) -- a great source of free high quality music under the Creative Commons license.
