I occasionally create videos about math/computer science that I put up on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IaBSHmisYbiYlv32EeNkQ), written in Python with Manim. Their source code is open and can be [found here](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/videos).

Regarding tooling, I use `sox` and `arecord` to record and process the audio and **Kdenlive** + `ffmpeg` to cut the video. For music, I use the **[blue dots sessions](https://app.sessions.blue/)** website -- a great source of free high quality music under the Creative Commons license.

I also use **Vector Magic** to convert bitmap images to vectors for neat visualization of bitmap images (namely authors of proofs and algorithms I cover in the videos).

The rest of this page contains a list of all the videos by category, along with links to their YouTube, source code, subtitles and exports in various resolutions.
