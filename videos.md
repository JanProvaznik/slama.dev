I occasionally create videos about math/computer science that I put up on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IaBSHmisYbiYlv32EeNkQ), written in Python with Manim. Their source code can be found [here](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/videos).

## Graph Theory
- **[Vizing's theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZWZpQmGp0g)** - _A visual proof of Vizing's theorem about graph edge coloring._
- **[Weak Perfect Graph Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Koc63QhxPgk)** - _A proof of the weak perfect graph theorem._
