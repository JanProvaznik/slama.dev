Here is a list of songs that I listen to on a daily basis. 
Most of them are rock, but the list also includes other genres, such as metal or even pop music.

If you feel like the list is missing something that you feel I ought to listen to, let me know and I'll be sure to check it out!

### Soundtracks (games)
- **Ori and the Blind Forest** -- a calming set of piano/vocal melodies that are well-suited for studying and programming
- **Cuphead** -- a rare live-produced game soundtrack featuring various forms of jazz
- **Shovel Knight** -- if you love 8-bit music, then you'll really love this one!
